# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Critical invariant

Every nutrient field must be a numeric value or an explicit "missing" indicator. No silent zeros, no defaulting absent data to 0. This holds across all code paths: AI parsing, manual entry, edits, recalculations.

## Next.js 16 warning

Significant breaking changes from versions covered by most training data. Before writing any Next.js-specific code, check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` for current API conventions. Heed deprecation notices.

## Project

**NutriCalc** — parses pasted recipe text via AI, extracts ingredients, fetches nutritional data, and displays a macro/micronutrient summary.

PRD and stack decisions: `context/foundation/` — read before adding features.

## Architecture

**Framework:** Next.js 16 App Router (`src/app/`). Server Components by default; Client Components only when browser APIs or interactivity require it. Use Server Actions for the AI parsing flow.

**Path alias:** `@/*` → `./src/*`

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 — syntax differs significantly from v3. Use v4 docs, not v3 examples.

**Deployment:** Cloudflare Workers via `@opennextjs/cloudflare`. Avoid Node.js-only APIs; use Web API equivalents throughout.

**Planned integrations (not yet implemented):**

- Supabase — OAuth (Google/GitHub) + PostgreSQL for recipe storage
- Claude API — parse unstructured recipe text into structured ingredient lists
- External nutrition API (source TBD — see `context/foundation/prd.md`)

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Dev server (Next.js 16, Turbopack on by default)
npm run build    # Production build
npm run start    # Run production server
npm run lint     # ESLint (flat config — eslint.config.mjs)
```

No test runner configured yet. Add one before writing tests.

## ESLint config

Uses ESLint 9 flat config format (`eslint.config.mjs`). Do not create `.eslintrc.*` files — they are ignored in ESLint 9.

## Environment variables

Create `.env.local` with:

```
# AI parsing (key name TBD — check context/foundation/tech-stack.md when decided)
AI_API_KEY=

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

# Nutrition API (source TBD — see context/foundation/prd.md open questions)
NUTRITION_API_KEY=

# Cloudflare deployment
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=
```

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 5

Scale the single-change cycle into parallel work with **worktrees, goal-directed delegation, and multi-session orchestration**:

```
worktree per change -> /goal or claude -p -> PR -> review -> merge
```

The lesson focus is safe throughput: isolated contexts, choosing the right execution mode, and capping parallelism at review capacity.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code isolation** | |
| `git worktree add` | You need a separate working directory for a parallel change. One change per worktree, one fresh agent context per worktree. |
| **Complex changes** | |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | The change has multiple phases, needs manual gates, or benefits from interactive decision-making during execution. |
| **Simple changes** | |
| `/goal` | You have a clear, bounded task and want goal-directed delegation. The agent works autonomously toward the stated goal with a stop condition. |
| `claude -p` | You want headless execution for a well-defined task. The Ralph Wiggum loop (run, check, retry) is the universal autonomous pattern. |
| **Multi-session orchestration** | |
| Superset / Conductor / Antigravity / VS Code Agent View | You are running multiple agent sessions in parallel and need visibility, coordination, or session management across them. |

### Parallel work rules

- One change per worktree or isolated workspace. One fresh agent context per change.
- Choose interactive `/10x-implement` for complex changes, `/goal` or `claude -p` for simple ones.
- Parallelism is capped by review capacity. More agents without review means more unreviewed code, not higher throughput.
- The quality pain from faster shipping is intentional — it bridges into Module 3 testing gates.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not reteach interactive `/10x-implement` or `/10x-impl-review`; those are Lessons 2 and 3.
- Do not introduce testing strategy here. The quality pain is the motivation for Module 3.
- Worktrees are a mechanism for isolation, not the topic of a full git tutorial.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/` - active change folder
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation input for any execution mode

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
