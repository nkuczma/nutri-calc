# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Critical invariant

Every nutrient field must be a numeric value or an explicit "missing" indicator. No silent zeros, no defaulting absent data to 0. This holds across all code paths: AI parsing, manual entry, edits, recalculations.

## Next.js 16 warning

Significant breaking changes from versions covered by most training data. Before writing any Next.js-specific code, check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` for current API conventions. Heed deprecation notices.

## Project

**NutriCalc** — parses pasted recipe text via AI, extracts ingredients, fetches nutritional data, and displays a macro/micronutrient summary.

PRD and stack decisions: `context/foundation/` — read before adding features.

## Architecture

**Framework:** Next.js 16 App Router (`src/app/`). Server Components by default; Client Components only when browser APIs or interactivity require it. Use Server Actions for the AI parsing flow.

**Path alias:** `@/*` → `./src/*`

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 — syntax differs significantly from v3. Use v4 docs, not v3 examples.

**Deployment:** Cloudflare Workers via `@opennextjs/cloudflare`. Avoid Node.js-only APIs; use Web API equivalents throughout.

**Planned integrations (not yet implemented):**

- Supabase — OAuth (Google/GitHub) + PostgreSQL for recipe storage
- OpenRouter — parse unstructured recipe text into structured ingredient lists (Claude models via OpenRouter)
- External nutrition API (source TBD — see `context/foundation/prd.md`)

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Dev server (Next.js 16, Turbopack on by default)
npm run build    # Production build
npm run start    # Run production server
npm run lint     # ESLint (flat config — eslint.config.mjs)
```

No test runner configured yet. Add one before writing tests.

## ESLint config

Uses ESLint 9 flat config format (`eslint.config.mjs`). Do not create `.eslintrc.*` files — they are ignored in ESLint 9.

## Environment variables

Create `.env.local` with:

```
# OpenRouter (AI parsing via OpenRouter)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

# Nutrition API (source TBD — see context/foundation/prd.md open questions)
NUTRITION_API_KEY=

# Spoonacular (unit conversion — cups/tbsp/tsp → grams)
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=

# Cloudflare deployment
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=
```

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 4 (E2E Tests)

**For E2E tests, use the `/10x-e2e` skill.** It is the single source of truth
for the workflow — risk → seed test + rules → generate → review against the five
anti-patterns → re-prompt → verify. The skill's `references/` carry the full
rules, anti-patterns, seed pattern, and prompt-template.

A few hard rules that hold even before you invoke the skill:

- **Locators:** `getByRole` / `getByLabel` / `getByText` first; `getByTestId`
  only when accessibility attributes are ambiguous. Never CSS selectors, XPath,
  or DOM structure.
- **Never `page.waitForTimeout()`.** Wait for state: `toBeVisible()`,
  `waitForURL()`, `waitForResponse()`.
- **Test independence + cleanup.** Each test runs standalone — its own setup,
  action, assertion, and cleanup; unique ids (timestamp suffix) so parallel runs
  and re-runs don't collide.

Two boundaries to keep straight:

- **DOM (snapshot) is the default.** Vision (`--caps=vision`) is a supplement for
  visual-only risks (layout, z-index, animation); for pixel regression prefer
  deterministic tools (`toMatchSnapshot`, Argos, Lost Pixel). VLM model
  selection/cost is a debugging topic (Lesson 5), not testing.
- **Healer helps on selectors, harms on logic.** A changed selector → healer
  re-finds it (route through PR review). A changed business behavior → healer
  masks the bug; that failing-test-to-fix case is Lesson 5.

## E2E Testing Rules

- Use `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText` as primary locators. Fall back to `getByTestId` only when accessibility attributes are ambiguous. Never CSS selectors, XPath, or DOM structure.
- Each test must be independently runnable — own setup, action, assertion, and cleanup in one block.
- Never use `page.waitForTimeout()`. Wait for specific conditions: `toBeVisible()`, `waitForURL()`, `waitForResponse()`.
- Assert the business outcome (the risk from `test-plan.md`), not implementation details.
- Use unique identifiers (e.g. `Date.now()` suffix) for test data to avoid collisions in parallel runs or re-runs. Clean up in the same test.
- Use `storageState` for authentication — never log in through the UI in individual tests.
- Mock `page.route()` only for browser→server routes backed by expensive external APIs (`/api/normalize-units`, `/api/nutrition-summary`). Server Actions and Supabase reads run against the real DB.
- Handle `window.confirm` dialogs with `page.once('dialog', dialog => dialog.accept())` registered **before** any navigation or action that could trigger the dialog — not after.
