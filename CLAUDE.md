# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Critical invariant

Every nutrient field must be a numeric value or an explicit "missing" indicator. No silent zeros, no defaulting absent data to 0. This holds across all code paths: AI parsing, manual entry, edits, recalculations.

## Next.js 16 warning

Significant breaking changes from versions covered by most training data. Before writing any Next.js-specific code, check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` for current API conventions. Heed deprecation notices.

## Project

**NutriCalc** — parses pasted recipe text via AI, extracts ingredients, fetches nutritional data, and displays a macro/micronutrient summary.

PRD and stack decisions: `context/foundation/` — read before adding features.

## Architecture

**Framework:** Next.js 16 App Router (`src/app/`). Server Components by default; Client Components only when browser APIs or interactivity require it. Use Server Actions for the AI parsing flow.

**Path alias:** `@/*` → `./src/*`

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 — syntax differs significantly from v3. Use v4 docs, not v3 examples.

**Deployment:** Cloudflare Workers via `@opennextjs/cloudflare`. Avoid Node.js-only APIs; use Web API equivalents throughout.

**Planned integrations (not yet implemented):**
- Supabase — OAuth (Google/GitHub) + PostgreSQL for recipe storage
- Claude API — parse unstructured recipe text into structured ingredient lists
- External nutrition API (source TBD — see `context/foundation/prd.md`)

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Dev server (Next.js 16, Turbopack on by default)
npm run build    # Production build
npm run start    # Run production server
npm run lint     # ESLint (flat config — eslint.config.mjs)
```

No test runner configured yet. Add one before writing tests.

## ESLint config

Uses ESLint 9 flat config format (`eslint.config.mjs`). Do not create `.eslintrc.*` files — they are ignored in ESLint 9.

## Environment variables

Create `.env.local` with:

```
# AI parsing (key name TBD — check context/foundation/tech-stack.md when decided)
AI_API_KEY=

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

# Nutrition API (source TBD — see context/foundation/prd.md open questions)
NUTRITION_API_KEY=

# Cloudflare deployment
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=
```

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 1

Move from sprint-zero setup to project orchestration with the **roadmap chain**:

```
(Module 1 foundation docs) -> /10x-roadmap -> backlog-ready roadmap items
```

`/10x-roadmap` is the lesson focus. `/10x-new` is intentionally introduced in Module 2, Lesson 2, when a selected roadmap item becomes an implementation change folder.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Roadmap (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-roadmap` | You have `context/foundation/prd.md` and a scaffolded project baseline, and you need a vertical-first MVP roadmap. The skill reads the PRD, inspects the code baseline, uses available foundation docs such as `tech-stack.md`, `infrastructure.md`, and `deploy-plan.md`, then writes `context/foundation/roadmap.md`. Use it BEFORE creating per-change folders or implementation plans. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` / `/10x-tech-stack-selector` / `/10x-bootstrapper` / `/10x-agents-md` / `/10x-infra-research` | Bundled from Module 1 so foundation contracts can be fixed before roadmap sequencing. If roadmap generation exposes a PRD gap, repair the PRD before pretending the backlog is ready. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-roadmap` bridges product and implementation. It does not choose frameworks, design schemas, or write a per-change implementation plan.
- The output is `context/foundation/roadmap.md`: ordered milestones, vertical slices, bounded foundations, dependencies, unknowns, risk, and backlog handoff fields.
- Roadmap items should receive stable human-readable identifiers in backlog tools. The actual `context/changes/<change-id>/` folder is created in Lesson 2 with `/10x-new`.

### Roadmap boundaries

- Default to vertical slices: user-visible outcomes that cross UI, data, business logic, and integrations.
- Horizontal work is allowed only as a bounded enabler that names the downstream vertical milestone it unlocks.
- Avoid orphan horizontal work such as "build the whole database", "build all API endpoints", or "design the whole UI" before the first user-visible flow.
- Roadmap is not a calendar estimate. Do not invent dates, story points, or sprint velocity unless the user explicitly asks for a separate planning artifact.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/prd.md` - input
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` - optional input
- `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
