# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Critical invariant

Every nutrient field must be a numeric value or an explicit "missing" indicator. No silent zeros, no defaulting absent data to 0. This holds across all code paths: AI parsing, manual entry, edits, recalculations.

## Next.js 16 warning

Significant breaking changes from versions covered by most training data. Before writing any Next.js-specific code, check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` for current API conventions. Heed deprecation notices.

## Project

**NutriCalc** — parses pasted recipe text via AI, extracts ingredients, fetches nutritional data, and displays a macro/micronutrient summary.

PRD and stack decisions: `context/foundation/` — read before adding features.

## Architecture

**Framework:** Next.js 16 App Router (`src/app/`). Server Components by default; Client Components only when browser APIs or interactivity require it. Use Server Actions for the AI parsing flow.

**Path alias:** `@/*` → `./src/*`

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 — syntax differs significantly from v3. Use v4 docs, not v3 examples.

**Deployment:** Cloudflare Workers via `@opennextjs/cloudflare`. Avoid Node.js-only APIs; use Web API equivalents throughout.

**Planned integrations (not yet implemented):**

- Supabase — OAuth (Google/GitHub) + PostgreSQL for recipe storage
- OpenRouter — parse unstructured recipe text into structured ingredient lists (Claude models via OpenRouter)
- External nutrition API (source TBD — see `context/foundation/prd.md`)

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Dev server (Next.js 16, Turbopack on by default)
npm run build    # Production build
npm run start    # Run production server
npm run lint     # ESLint (flat config — eslint.config.mjs)
```

No test runner configured yet. Add one before writing tests.

## ESLint config

Uses ESLint 9 flat config format (`eslint.config.mjs`). Do not create `.eslintrc.*` files — they are ignored in ESLint 9.

## Environment variables

Create `.env.local` with:

```
# OpenRouter (AI parsing via OpenRouter)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

# Nutrition API (source TBD — see context/foundation/prd.md open questions)
NUTRITION_API_KEY=

# Spoonacular (unit conversion — cups/tbsp/tsp → grams)
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=

# Cloudflare deployment
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=
```

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 3

Lesson 3 is about **hooks** — turning the quality gates from Lesson 1 and the tests from Lesson 2 into automatic, deterministic checks that fire while the agent works. A hook runs outside the model, so it survives context compression, instruction changes, and the model "forgetting". The payoff for agentic hooks specifically: a `PostToolUse` check can feed its result back into the agent's context, so the agent fixes trivial errors (formatting, a missing import, a wrong type) on its own in the next iteration instead of you discovering them minutes later.

### Task Router — Which layer for this check

| You want to | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| React the instant the agent edits a file | A per-edit hook (`PostToolUse` matcher `Write\|Edit` in Claude Code). Right for fast checks: lint/format, and scoped tests on risk-area files. This is the **only** layer that can hand feedback to the agent mid-session. |
| Run only the tests that depend on the edited file | Parse the path from the hook's stdin (`jq -r .tool_input.file_path`) and run your runner's related-tests mode (`vitest related "$FILE" --run`, `jest --findRelatedTests $FILE`). Gate it on whether the file is a risk area in `test-plan.md`; don't run tests on every helper or config edit. |
| Catch changes that bypassed the agent (manual edits, a teammate's commit) | A pre-commit git hook (Lefthook or Husky+lint-staged) over staged files: lint + typecheck, and tests on staged risk files. |
| Run heavier checks before code leaves the machine | Pre-push: full typecheck or a broader test set. Anything too slow for per-edit moves here. |
| Decide where a given gate belongs | Ask: is it fast enough (a few seconds) for per-edit, or should it wait for commit/push/CI? Slow checks block the agent loop on every edit — push them up a layer. |
| Use the same hook across tools | The trigger → matcher → handler → signal pattern is the same in Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, and Copilot; only the config file and event names change. See the cross-tool table below. |

### Hook lifecycle — the universal pattern

Every tool's hooks follow four steps:

1. **Trigger** — an event in the tool (e.g. the agent just saved a file: `PostToolUse`).
2. **Matcher** — a filter deciding whether this hook runs (tool name like `Write`/`Edit`, file type, or a name pattern).
3. **Handler** — the action that runs, usually a shell command.
4. **Signal** — the result returns to the tool. The exit code says pass/fail; stdout can flow into the agent's context as feedback.

### Exit codes and the feedback loop

- **0** — success; the hook passed, continue.
- **2** — blocking error; the agent sees the feedback and should react.
- **anything else** — non-blocking error; logged, but does not interrupt work.

On a blocking failure, stdout flows into the agent's context (in Claude Code via `additionalContext`, capped at 10,000 characters; other tools have similar mechanisms with their own limits). That is why the agent can self-correct: it sees the concrete message — missing type, unimported module, badly formatted line — not just "something failed".

The boundary: the agent reliably fixes **trivial** corrections on its own. When a test fails because of wrong business logic, the hook surfaces it but the agent may not diagnose the real cause — it says "something is off" and tries a trivial fix. If that does not resolve in one or two tries, the signal comes back to you, and the problem may deserve its own change-id with the full `/10x-new → /10x-research → /10x-plan → /10x-implement` workflow.

### Three local layers (plus CI)

| Layer | Catches | Timing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-edit (agent hooks) | Formatting, simple type errors, failing unit tests on risk files. Only layer that feeds the agent mid-work. | ms–s |
| Pre-commit (git hooks) | What slipped past per-edit: manual edits, files changed outside the hook, checks too slow for per-edit. Operates on staged files. | s |
| Pre-push | Heavier checks before pushing to remote (full typecheck, broader test set). | s–min |
| CI | Integration problems, cross-module dependencies, checks needing infra unavailable locally. | min |

Local layers do **not** replace CI — CI stays the key verification for shared repo state and environments you don't control. But each local layer that catches an error is one fewer CI round-trip. You don't need all layers from day one: start with one per-edit hook (lint) and one commit gate, add layers as you see what escapes. The quality gates in `test-plan.md §4` decide which checks are worth automating and when; a plan may legitimately defer per-edit hooks if the cost/signal ratio isn't there yet.

### Key rules

- Keep per-edit hooks fast. If a check takes more than a few seconds, move it to commit, push, or CI — a slow per-edit hook blocks the agent loop on every edit. Lint/format are ideal per-edit; full typecheck is often a commit gate in larger projects.
- Run scoped tests, not the whole suite, per edit — only tests related to the edited file, and only when that file is a risk area in `test-plan.md`.
- `related` is a subcommand, not a flag (`vitest related`, not `--related`). Use `--run` so the hook terminates instead of entering watch mode.
- `PostToolUse` fires once per tool use; three edits in one turn fire it three times independently — there is no built-in aggregation.
- The git hook tool (Lefthook vs Husky+lint-staged) is an implementation detail; the rule is the same — run checks on staged files before commit. If Husky already works, don't migrate.
- **Context injection is not universal.** Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Copilot (in VS Code) can pass a hook's result to the agent; Windsurf cannot — it can block (exit 2) but can't tell the agent what went wrong.

### The same pattern in every tool

| Tool | Events | Handlers | Context injection | Config |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | ~30 | command, http, mcp_tool, prompt, agent | yes | `.claude/settings.json` |
| Cursor | ~18 | command, prompt | yes | `.cursor/hooks.json` |
| Codex | 10 | command | yes | `.codex/hooks.json` |
| Windsurf | 12 | command | **no** | `.windsurf/hooks.json` |
| Copilot | ~13 | command, http, prompt | yes (VS Code) | `.github/hooks/*.json` |

### Lesson boundaries

- This lesson configures hooks and local quality layers only. The hook JSON, `lefthook.yml`, and the per-edit/commit/push layering are the scope.
- Do not write E2E tests, configure Playwright/MCP, or run browser scenarios. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test debugging workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not change the risk strategy or quality-gate definitions. That is Lesson 1 (`/10x-test-plan`); read current state with `/10x-test-plan --status`.
- Do not write unit/integration test code from scratch here. That is Lesson 2 — hooks only *run* the tests those lessons produced.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines. That is Module 1 Lesson 5 / Module 2 Lesson 5; hooks are the local layers in front of CI.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `.claude/settings.json` — hook configuration (`~/.claude/settings.json` global, `.claude/settings.json` project, `.claude/settings.local.json` local overrides). Other tools use their own config file (see the table).
- `lefthook.yml` — pre-commit git hook config (lint + typecheck + tests on `{staged_files}`).
- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — §4 quality gates decide which checks to automate and at which layer; risk areas decide which edits warrant scoped tests.
